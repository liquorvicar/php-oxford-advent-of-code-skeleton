## PHPOxford Advent of Code skeleton

This is designed to get you up and running with the minimal effort. It has no bells and whistles but a very minimal setup with PHPUnit.

- `composer test` - will run all tests
- `composer one` - will run the first part of your answer
- `composer two` - will run the second part of your answer

Have fun!
